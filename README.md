# Instagram Insights
This is the repo for my Instagram Insights web application.

## Description & Usage
Instagram does not have a public API that can be used to gather a list of followers & following. In order to track who has unfollowed you, or who does not follow you back, it is necessary to get this list of your followers & following.

Instagram Insights is a web application that gathers all of your Instagram data - data that is otherwise not provided with Instagram API's. 

This web application will
- take your Instagram username and password
- collect your followers & following
- return a list of people not following you back
- return a list of people who have unfollowed you
- give you other analytics

To run the code locally, run 
```bash
node app.js
```

## Note
The npm packages (node_modules) are not included. To run the code locally, run:
